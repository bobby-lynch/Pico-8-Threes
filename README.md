This is a demake of the game Threes made by myself using the Pico-8.
It is currently just a side project that I'm working on as a fun learning exercise.

Threes is a puzzle game made by Asher Volmer and Greg Wohlwend with music made by Jimmy Hinson.
If you haven't played the original game yet, please consider supporting its developers by downloading and playing it.

I've been using [kamikaze28's threes guide](https://toucharcade.com/community/threads/threes-by-sirvo-llc.218248/page-27#post-3140044) on the TouchArcade forum as my primary reference for understanding how certain hidden mechanics from the original game work. Thanks to them and everyone else who contributed on that thread.

Please don't attempt to monetize or reupload this. It's just a fan-made tribute to the original, and is not intended as a rip-off in the vein of clones like 2048.
I highly recommend reading [this post](https://asherv.com/threes/threemails/) by Asher and Greg, which talks about Threes clones and extensively details the development process of the original game.
